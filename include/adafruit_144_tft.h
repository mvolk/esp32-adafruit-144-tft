 * This is a library for several Adafruit displays based on ST77* drivers.
 * Works with the Adafruit 1.8" TFT Breakout w/SD card
 *   ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/358
 * The 1.8" TFT shield
 *   ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/802
 * The 1.44" TFT breakout
 *   ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/2088
 * as well as Adafruit raw 1.8" TFT display
 *   ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/618
 * Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
 * These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to
 * interface (RST is optional).
 * Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
